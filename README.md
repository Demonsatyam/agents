# 🧠 Building Intelligent Agents — From Basics to Advanced

Welcome to the **Agents Learning Repository**!

In this repository, we will be learning how to **build intelligent agents**, starting from the very basics and progressing towards advanced concepts. Whether you're just beginning your journey or looking to deepen your understanding, this repo is structured to guide you through the entire learning path step-by-step.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- Fundamentals of agents and agent-based systems
- How to build simple reactive agents
- Designing and implementing stateful agents
- Agent communication and collaboration
- Using tools and frameworks to enhance agent intelligence
- Real-world applications: automation, assistants, and more
- Advanced agent architectures: multi-agent systems, LLM-powered agents, and autonomous workflows
